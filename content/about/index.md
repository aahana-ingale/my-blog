## Hey there, I am Aahana! :waving_hand:

Hello I am Aahana Ingale! Good food is what keeps me going. Thus, I chose a career based on that. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Food Nutrition and Dietetics. I look forward sharing my experiences and insights with you'll. Since Good Food ends with Good talk, tips is what will be served always!!
