I don’t know when it happened, but somewhere along the way carbs became the villain of every weight loss conversation.

Suddenly, roti is “too much.”  
Rice is “the reason you’re not losing weight.”  
And ordering anything with bread comes with guilt.

I’ve had so many girls casually tell me, “I think I’ll just go keto.” Like it’s the obvious next step. Like cutting carbs is the responsible thing to do.

And every time I hear that, I pause.  
Not because keto is fake.  
But because I wonder: are we choosing it from understanding, or from pressure?

## What Keto Actually Is (Minus the Drama)

At its core, keto is just a very low-carbohydrate diet, usually under 50 grams of carbs a day. It’s high in fat and moderate in protein.

When you cut carbs that low, your body switches fuel sources. Instead of using glucose from carbs, it starts using fat and produces ketones. That state is called ketosis.

It’s a real metabolic process. It’s not made up.

But just because something is metabolically interesting doesn’t mean everyone needs to do it.

## Why The Weight Drops So Fast

{{< figure

This is the part that makes keto look almost magical.

When you reduce carbs:

- Your body uses up stored glycogen.  
- Glycogen holds water.  
- When it drops, water drops too.  

So the number on the scale goes down quickly.

And for someone who has been struggling with their weight, seeing that drop feels validating. It feels like, “Finally, something is working.”

But a lot of that early drop is water, not just fat.

That doesn’t mean keto doesn’t work. It just means the story is more layered than social media makes it seem.

## What Research Actually Shows

Keto can help with short-term weight loss.  
It can improve blood sugar levels.  
It can reduce triglycerides.

It’s even used medically for conditions like drug-resistant epilepsy, and in that context, it’s incredibly valuable.

But when researchers look at long-term results, something interesting shows up.

After about 6 to 12 months, weight loss differences between keto and other balanced diets often level out.

Which basically tells us: consistency matters more than extremes.

## What Makes Me Slightly Uncomfortable

What worries me isn’t keto itself.  
It’s who is trying it and why.

Teenage girls who are still growing.  
College students who already skip meals.  
Young working women who are stressed, sleep-deprived, and barely hydrated.

When you combine:

- Very low carbs  
- High stress  
- Irregular eating  
- Intense workouts  

The body can start feeling it.

Some people experience:

- Low energy  
- Mood swings  
- Headaches  
- Constipation  

And sometimes, menstrual cycles get irregular.

Not for everyone. But enough that we shouldn’t ignore it.

Your period is not just a monthly inconvenience. It’s a health signal.

## The Social Side We Don’t Talk About

Can you realistically avoid:

- Family dinners?  
- Festival sweets?  
- Office birthday cakes?  
- Your comfort food on a bad day?  

If a diet makes you anxious around normal food situations, that’s something to think about.

Restriction can easily turn into:

Restriction → craving → overeating → guilt → restarting.

And that cycle is exhausting.

## So Is Keto Wrong?

No.

It can be helpful in specific medical or metabolic situations. Under supervision, it can be structured well.

But if you’re 17 and trying to lose 3 to 4 kilos because you don’t like how you look in pictures…

Or 25 and feeling bloated because work has messed up your routine…

You probably don’t need to remove an entire macronutrient.

You might just need:

- Regular meals  
- Enough protein  
- Better sleep  
- Some movement  
- Less comparison

## A Small Reminder

Roti is not toxic.  
Rice is not ruining your body.  
Fruit is not making you gain weight overnight.

Carbs are not the enemy.

Sometimes I feel like we’re not actually scared of carbs. We’re scared of not looking a certain way.

And that’s a very different issue.

## Final Thoughts

Keto isn’t fake. It’s not stupid. It’s not evil.

But it’s also not magic.

It’s one dietary pattern. Not a personality. Not a solution to insecurity. Not a shortcut to confidence.

Before starting something extreme, I always think it’s worth asking:

Am I choosing this because it suits my body, or because I feel pressured?

Health shouldn’t feel like punishment.

And sometimes, eating balanced meals consistently, without fear, is the most rebellious thing you can do in a world obsessed with extremes.
